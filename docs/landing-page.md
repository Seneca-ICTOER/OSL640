## What This Course is About

Unix and Linux represent the operating system technology powering many of the services we access every day - from Smart Phones, Cloud Computing and the Internet. Unix and Linux systems are often used to provide core services for companies as they are stable and secure. Updating is simple and does not usually require a system reboot unless the Kernel is updated. This subject introduces students to Unix and Linux.

Students will learn the core utilities to work productively in a Linux environment. Students will do this work using the shell on a live Linux cluster. Students will learn to configure their login accounts, manipulate data stored in files, effectively use Linux commands and utilities, and write simple shell scripts.

**Note**: Important resources on this wiki have been highlighted in Yellow.

## Accessing Your Linux Computer Account

You will need a **matrix** computer account to do the OSL640 tutorials. If you have never logged into matrix before, check your [MySeneca email](https://myseneca.ca/) for confirmation that your matrix account was automatically created after you registered for OSL640. This should happen automatically if you are a new Seneca student and this is your first semester.

**Logging in to matrix**: After successfully logging into matrix from the college computers, there are several other ways you can login to matrix depending on your operating system of choice.

Please see the following [guide](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~uli101/notes/MatrixLoginInformation.pdf) for detailed instructions. [Tutorial 1](/A-Tutorials/tutorial1.md) will provide you remote access to the Matrix cluster. You will work on Tutorial 1 during your first lab class.

**In case of problems with:**

  - logging into your matrix account
  - matrix not finding your home directory and you cannot start the assignments
  - any other matrix issue

Please email [servicedesk@senecacollege.ca](mailto:servicedesk@senecacollege.ca) and specify the exact error message you received. It would help if you snap a picture of your screen or take a screen capture of your error message and attach to your email when you contact ServiceDesk through your MySeneca email.
